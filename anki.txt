South	My background is in software, not climate science, and these days my fulltime job is working with my wife, Melinda, at the Gates Foundation, where we are superfocused on global health, development, and U.S. education.I came to focus on climate change in an indirect way—through the problem of energy poverty.In the early 2000s, when our foundation was just starting out, I began traveling to lowincome countries in subSaharan Africa and South Asia so I could learn more about child mortality, HIV, and the other big problems we were working on.	{'n. the region of the United States lying to the south of the Mason-Dixon line\nn. the cardinal compass point that is at 180 degrees\nn. a location in the southern part of a country, region, or city\nn. the direction corresponding to the southward cardinal compass point', 'sauθ', 'n. 南方, 南\na. 南的, 向南的\nadv. 在南方\nvi. 转向南方', 'south'}

ambition	First, we have ambition, thanks to the passion of a growing global movement led by young people who are deeply concerned about climate change.	"{'n. 野心, 志向', 'ambition', ""æm'biʃәn"", ""n. a cherished desire\nn. a strong drive for success\nv. have as one's ambition""}"
physic	Second, we have big goals for solving the problem as more national and local leaders around the world commit to doing their part.Now we need the third component: a concrete plan to achieve our goals.Just as our ambitions have been driven by an appreciation for climate science, any practical plan for reducing emissions has to be driven by other disciplines: physics, chemistry, biology, engineering, political science, economics, finance, and more.

hotter	And once greenhouse gases are in the atmosphere, they stay there for a very long time; something like onefifth of the carbon dioxide emitted today will still be there in 10,000 years.There’s no scenario in which we keep adding carbon to the atmosphere and the world stops getting hotter, and the hotter it gets, the harder it will be for humans to survive, much less thrive.	"{'a used of physical heat; having a high or higher than desirable temperature or giving off heat or feeling or causing a sensation of heat or burning\ns characterized by violent and forceful activity or movement; very intense\na extended meanings; especially of psychological heat; marked by intensity or vehemence especially of passion or enthusiasm\ns (color) bold and intense\ns sexually excited or exciting\ns recently stolen or smuggled\ns very fast; capable of quick response and great speed\ns wanted by the police\ns producing a burning sensation on the taste nerves\ns performed or performing with unusually great skill and daring and energy\ns very popular or successful\ns very unpleasant or even dangerous\ns newest or most recent\ns having or bringing unusually good luck\ns very good; often used in the negative\ns newly made\ns having or showing great eagerness or enthusiasm\ns of a seeker; very near to the object sought\ns having or dealing with dangerously high levels of radioactivity\ns charged or energized with electricity\ns marked by excited activity', 'a. 热的；热烈的', 'hotter', ""'hɔtә(r)""}"
imprecisely	And, because greenhouse gases remain in the atmosphere for so long, the planet will stay warm for a long time even after we get to zero.Admittedly, I’m using “zero” imprecisely, and I should be clear about what I mean.	"{'r. in an imprecise manner', 'imprecisely', 'adv. 不严密地', ""ˌɪmprɪ'saɪslɪ""}"
preindustrial	In preindustrial times—before the mid18th century or so—the earth’s carbon cycle was probably roughly in balance; that is, plants and other things absorbed about as much carbon dioxide as was emitted.But then we started burning fossil fuels.

methane	When we dig up those fuels and burn them, we emit extra carbon and add to the total amount in the atmosphere.There are no realistic paths to zero that involve abandoning these fuels completely or stopping all the other activities that also produce greenhouse gases (like making cement, using fertilizer, or letting methane leak out of natural gas power plants).

Celsius	In this chapter I want to share some of what I’ve learned.A Little Is a LotI was surprised when I learned that what sounded like a small increase in the global temperature—just 1 or 2 degrees Celsius, which is 1.8 to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit—could actually cause a lot of trouble.	"{'a. 摄氏的', 'n. Swedish astronomer who devised the centigrade thermometer (1701-1744)', ""'selsiәs"", 'celsius'}"
obscure	During the age of the dinosaurs, when the average temperature was perhaps 4 degrees Celsius higher than today, there were crocodiles living above the Arctic Circle.It’s also important to remember that these average numbers can obscure a pretty big range of temperatures.

sweating	Basically, continents aren’t sweating as much as they used to.So what does a warming planet have to do with greenhouse gas emissions?

"{'n. 分子, 些微\n[化] 分子', 'n. (physics and chemistry) the simplest structural unit of an element or compound', ""'mɒlikju:l"", 'molecule'}"
glaze	For the sake of variety, and because reading “greenhouse gas” a hundred times will make your eyes glaze over, I’ll sometimes use “carbon” as a synonym for carbon dioxide and the other gases.Greenhouse gas emissions have increased dramatically since the 1850s due to human activity, such as burning fossil fuels.	"{'n. any of various thin shiny (savory or sweet) coatings applied to foods\nn. a glossy finish on a fabric\nn. a coating for ceramics, metal, etc.\nv. coat with a glaze', ""'gleiz"", 'n. 釉, 上光, 光滑面\nvt. 装以玻璃, 上釉于\nvi. 变得光滑, (目光)变呆滞', 'glaze'}"

windshield	They work the same way a greenhouse works—hence the name.You’ve actually seen the greenhouse effect in action on a very different scale, whenever your car is sitting outside in the sun: Your windshield lets sunlight in, then traps some of that energy.	"{'n. 挡风玻璃\n[电] 风遮蔽', ""'windʃi:ld"", 'windshield', 'n. transparent screen (as of glass) to protect occupants of a vehicle'}"
sunlight	They work the same way a greenhouse works—hence the name.You’ve actually seen the greenhouse effect in action on a very different scale, whenever your car is sitting outside in the sun: Your windshield lets sunlight in, then traps some of that energy.	"{'sunlight', ""'sʌnlait"", 'n. the rays of the sun', 'n. 日光\n[医] 日光, 太阳光'}"

vibrate	As you may recall from physics class, all molecules vibrate; the faster they vibrate, the hotter they are.	"{""'vaibreit"", 'vibrate', 'v. shake, quiver, or throb; move back and forth rapidly, usually in an uncontrolled manner', 'vi. 振动, 颤动, 激动, 摇摆, 踌躇\nvt. 使颤动, 使振动, 使摆动'}"
soak	When certain types of molecules are hit with radiation at certain wavelengths, they block the radiation, soak up its energy, and vibrate faster.But not all radiation is on the right wavelengths to cause this effect.	{'n. 浸, 湿透, 大雨\nvt. 使上下湿透, 浸, 吸入, 吸收, 浸洗掉\nvi. 浸泡, 渗透', 'soak', 'sәuk', 'n. the process of becoming softened and saturated as a consequence of being immersed in water (or other liquid)\nn. washing something by allowing it to soak\nv. submerge in a liquid\nv. beat severely'}
unbearably	Most of it reaches the earth and warms up the planet, just as it has been doing for eons.Here’s the problem: The earth doesn’t hold on to all that energy forever; if it did, the planet would already be unbearably hot.	"{'adv. 不能忍受地, 无法容忍地; 慌', ""ʌn'beərəblɪ"", 'unbearably', 'r. to an unbearable degree'}"
harmlessly	Rather than going out harmlessly into the void, it hits the greenhouse molecules and makes them vibrate faster, heating up the atmosphere.	{'harmlessly', '', 'adv. 无害地；无恶意地', 'r. in a harmless manner'}

overdrive	The problem is that all these extra greenhouse gases are sending the effect into overdrive.

instill	[]	"{'instill', 'v. impart gradually\nv. enter drop by drop', 'vt. 滴注, 慢慢地灌输', ""in'stil""}"
catastrophic	Yet if nothing else changes, the world will keep producing greenhouse gases, climate change will keep getting worse, and the impact on humans will in all likelihood be catastrophic.But “if nothing else changes” is a big If.	"{'s. extremely harmful; bringing physical or financial ruin', 'a. 悲惨的, 灾难的', 'catastrophic', "".kætә'strɒfik""}"
caveat	Before I explain what’s coming, I have to give you one caveat: Although we can predict the course of broad trends, like “there will be more hot days” and “sea levels will go up,” we can’t with certainty blame climate change for any particular event.	"{""'keiviæt"", 'n. (law) a formal notice filed with a court or officer to suspend a proceeding until filer is given a hearing', 'caveat', 'n. 中止诉讼程序的申请, 警告\n[经] 停止支付的广告, 货物出门概不退换'}"
certainty	IPCC reports acknowledge up front some uncertainty about how much and how quickly the temperature will go up, for example, and exactly what effect these higher temperatures will have.One problem is that computer models are far from perfect.	"{'n. 确定, 确实的事情\n[法] 确定, 肯定, 必然的事', ""'sә:tәnti"", 'certainty', 'n. the state of being certain\nn. something that is certain'}"
unclear	For hurricanes, it’s unclear whether warmer oceans are causing a rise in the number of storms, but there is growing evidence that climate change is making storms wetter and increasing the number of intense ones.	"{'a. 不易了解的, 不清楚的, 含混的', "".ʌn'kliә"", 'unclear', 'a. not clear to the mind'}"

soda	Meanwhile, Costco sells 8 liters of soda for $6, a price that amounts to $2.85 a gallon.Even after you account for fluctuations in the price of oil, the conclusion is the same: Every day, people around the world rely on more than 4 billion gallons of a product that costs less than Diet Coke.It’s no accident that fossil fuels are so cheap.

incur	It’s hard to get every country in the world to agree on anything—especially when you’re asking them to incur some new cost, like the expense of curbing carbon emissions.	"{'v. make oneself subject to; bring upon oneself; become liable to', 'incur', ""in'kә:"", 'vt. 招致, 蒙受, 遭遇\n[经] 招致, 蒙受, 担负'}"

omission	The article didn’t say, and that kind of omission was surprisingly common.Eventually, I built a mental framework for the things I was learning.

digging	I’ve found that this approach helps with almost any new topic I’m digging into: I try to get the big picture first, because that gives me the context to understand new information.	"{'n the act of digging\nv turn up, loosen, or remove earth\nv create by digging\nv work hard\nv remove, harvest, or recover by digging\nv thrust down or into\nv remove the inner part or the core of\nv poke or thrust abruptly\nv get the meaning of something', ""'digiŋ"", 'n. 挖掘', 'digging'}"

converting	How Much of the 51 Billion Tons Are We Talking About?Whenever I read something that mentions some amount of greenhouse gases, I do some quick math, converting it into a percentage of the annual total of 51 billion tons.	"{'v change from one system to another or to a new plan or policy\nv change the nature, purpose, or function of something\nv change religious beliefs, or adopt a religious belief\nv exchange or replace with another, usually of the same kind or category\nv cause to adopt a new or different faith\nv score an extra point or points after touchdown by kicking the ball through the uprights or advancing the ball into the end zone\nv complete successfully\nv score (a spare)\nv make (someone) agree, understand, or realize the truth or validity of something\nv exchange a penalty for a less severe one\nv change in nature, purpose, or function; undergo a chemical change', ""kәn'vә:tiŋ"", 'converting', '[建] 转化, 改变'}"

tackling	What’s Your Plan for Cement?If you’re talking about a comprehensive plan for tackling climate change, you need to consider everything that humans do to cause greenhouse gas emissions.

shorthand	So the question “What’s your plan for cement?” is just a shorthand reminder that if you’re trying to come up with a comprehensive plan for climate change, you have to account for much more than electricity and cars.Here’s a breakdown of all the human activities that produce greenhouse gases.	"{""'ʃɒ:thænd"", 'n. 速记\n[法] 速记法, 速记, 记录文字', 'n. a method of writing rapidly\ns. written in abbreviated or symbolic form', 'shorthand'}"

aback	I know I was taken aback when I learned this: Because most of the articles I read about climate change focused on electricity generation, I assumed it must be the main culprit.The good news is that even though electricity is only 27 percent of the problem, it could represent much more than 27 percent of the solution.	"{'r. having the wind against the forward side of the sails\nr. by surprise', 'aback', ""ә'bæk"", 'adv. 向后, 朝后, 突然, 船顶风地'}"

transformative	The project is supposed to become operational in 2024—some 17 years after planning began.But if we could pull this off, it would be transformative.	"{""træns'fɔ:mәtiv"", 'transformative', 'a. Having power, or a tendency, to transform.', 'a. 有改革能力的, 起改造作用的'}"
complication	I hope to see a lot more projects like this one.Here’s another complication: As our houses rely less on fossil fuels and more on electricity (for example, to power electric cars and stay warm in the winter), we’ll need to upgrade the electrical service to each household—by at least a factor of two, and in many cases even more than that.	"{'n. 复杂化, 复杂情况\n[医] 并发症, 并发病', 'complication', "".kɒmpli'keiʃәn"", 'n. the act or process of complicating\nn. a situation or condition that is complex or confused\nn. any disease or disorder that occurs during the course of (or because of) another disease\nn. a development that complicates a situation'}"
eyesore	For example, power lines are less of an eyesore if they’re run underground.	"{'eyesore', 'n. something very ugly and offensive', ""'aisɒ:"", 'n. 眼中钉'}"
burying	But today, burying power lines increases the cost by a factor of 5 to 10.	"{'burying', 'n. 葬礼, 埋葬', 'n. concealing something under the ground', ""'beriiŋ""}"
frankly	These ideas are in various stages of development; some are relatively mature and well tested, while others are, frankly, nuts.	"{'adv. 坦白地', 'frankly', ""r (used as intensives reflecting the speaker's attitude) it is sincerely the case that"", ""'fræŋkli""}"
reliably	That means you’ll need to supplement them with other sources to get one gigawatt reliably.Tip: Whenever you hear “kilowatt,” think “house.” “Gigawatt,” think “city.” A hundred or more gigawatts, think “big country.”4.	"{""ri'laiәbli"", 'adv. 可靠地, 可信赖地', 'reliably', 'r in a faithful manner'}"
splitting	(Here I mean nuclear fission—the process of getting energy by splitting atoms apart.	"{'splitting', 'a. 爆裂似的, 极快的\n[化] 剖层', ""'splitiŋ"", ""v separate into parts or portions\nv separate or cut with a tool, such as a sharp instrument\nv discontinue an association or relation; go different ways\nv go one's own way; move apart\nv come open suddenly and violently, as if from internal pressure\ns resembling a sound of violent tearing as of something ripped apart or lightning splitting a tree""}"
foresee	Remember that by comparison solar and wind together provide about 7 percent worldwide.And it’s hard to foresee a future where we decarbonize our power grid affordably without using more nuclear power.	"{'v realize beforehand\nv picture to oneself; imagine possible\nv act in advance of; deal with ahead of time', ""fɒ:'si:"", 'vt. 预见, 预知', 'foresee'}"
ridiculous	Let’s stop driving and give up these automobiles.” That would’ve been ridiculous, of course.	"{'ridiculous', 's inspiring scornful pity\ns incongruous; inviting ridicule\ns broadly or extravagantly humorous; resembling farce', 'a. 荒谬的, 可笑的', ""ri'dikjulәs""}"
reactor	I’m very optimistic about the approach created by TerraPower, a company I founded in 2008, bringing together some of the best minds in nuclear physics and computer modeling to design a nextgeneration nuclear reactor.Because no one was going to let us build experimental reactors in the real world, we set up a lab of supercomputers in Bellevue, Washington, where the team runs digital simulations of different reactor designs.	"{'n. 反应者, 反应器, 反应堆, 电抗器\n[化] 反应釜; 反应锅', 'n. an electrical device used to introduce reactance into a circuit', 'reactor', ""ri'æktә""}"
ingenious	Finally, the design would be inherently safe, using some ingenious features to control the nuclear reaction; for example, the radioactive fuel is contained in pins that expand if they get too hot, which slows the nuclear reaction down and prevents overheating.	"{'a. 灵敏的, 精巧的, 聪明的', 'ingenious', ""in'dʒi:njәs"", 's showing inventiveness and skill'}"
radioactive	Finally, the design would be inherently safe, using some ingenious features to control the nuclear reaction; for example, the radioactive fuel is contained in pins that expand if they get too hot, which slows the nuclear reaction down and prevents overheating.	"{"".reidiәu'æktiv"", 'a. exhibiting or caused by radioactivity', 'a. 放射性的, 有放射能的\n[医] 放射性的, 放射的', 'radioactive'}"
slows	Finally, the design would be inherently safe, using some ingenious features to control the nuclear reaction; for example, the radioactive fuel is contained in pins that expand if they get too hot, which slows the nuclear reaction down and prevents overheating.	{'', 'v. 减速（slow的第三人称单数）', 'v lose velocity; move more slowly\nv become slow or slower\nv cause to proceed more slowly', 'slows'}
electrically	You start with a gas—most research focuses on certain types of hydrogen—and get it extraordinarily hot, well over 50 million degrees Celsius, while it’s in an electrically charged state known as plasma.	"{'adv. 电力地；有关电地', ""i'lektrikәli"", 'electrically', 'r. by electricity'}"
fuse	At these temperatures, the particles are moving so fast that they hit each other and fuse together, just as the hydrogen atoms in the sun do.	{'fju:z', 'n. an electrical device that can interrupt the flow of electrical current when it is overloaded\nn. any igniter that is used to initiate the burning of a propellant\nv. become plastic or fluid or liquefied from heat\nv. equip with a fuse; provide with a fuse', 'fuse', 'n. 保险丝, 导火线\nv. 熔化, 融合'}
helium	When the hydrogen particles fuse, they turn into helium, and in the process they release a great deal of energy, which can be used to generate electricity.	"{'helium', 'n. 氦\n[化] 氦', ""'hi:liәm"", 'n. a very light colorless element that is one of the six inert gasses; the most difficult gas to liquefy; occurs in economically extractable amounts in certain natural gases (as those found in Texas and Kansas)'}"
plutonium	Fusion’s waste products would be radioactive for hundreds of years, versus hundreds of thousands for waste plutonium and other elements from fission, and at a much lower level—about as dangerous as radioactive hospital waste.	"{'plutonium', 'n. a solid silvery grey radioactive transuranic element whose atoms can be split when bombarded with neutrons; found in minute quantities in uranium ores but is usually synthesized in nuclear reactors; 13 isotopes are known with the most important being plutonium 239', ""plu:'tәuniәm"", 'n. 钚\n[化] 钚Pu'}"
loosely	There’s an old joke among nuclear scientists: “Fusion is 40 years away, and it always will be.” (Admittedly, I’m using the term “joke” loosely.)	"{'loosely', 'r. in a relaxed manner; not rigid\nr. in a loose manner\nr. knitted in a loose manner', ""'lu:sli"", 'adv. 松弛地, 宽松地, 不紧'}"
eater	You might have enjoyed nitrous oxide at the dentist’s office—it’s also known as laughing gas—and methane is the main ingredient in the natural gas that you might use to run your stove or water heater.	"{""'i:tә"", 'n. someone who consumes food for nourishment\nn. any green goods that are good to eat', 'eater', 'n. 吃...的人, 生吃的水果, 美味的水果'}"
accomplishment	That would be the Kitty Hawk moment for fusion, a major accomplishment that would put us on the path to building a commercial demonstration plant.And there are more innovations coming that could make fusion more practical.	"{'accomplishment', 'n. the action of accomplishing something', 'n. 成就, 完成', ""ә'kʌmpliʃmәnt""}"
steadily	Offshore winds generally blow more steadily, so intermittency is less of an issue too.Despite these advantages, offshore wind currently represents only a tiny share of the world’s total capacity for generating electricity—about 0.4 percent in 2019.	"{""'stedili"", 'adv. 稳定地, 无变化地, 有规则地', 'steadily', 'r. at a steady rate or pace\nr. in a steady manner'}"
clever	The U.K. is the world’s biggest user of offshore wind today, thanks to clever government subsidies that encouraged companies to invest in it.	"{""'klevә"", 'clever', 's. showing inventiveness and skill', 'a. 聪明的, 精明的'}"
bureaucratic	Today, getting a permit requires you to run a bureaucratic gauntlet: You buy one of a limited number of federal leases, then go through a multiyear process to generate an environmental impact statement, then get additional state and local permits.	"{'a. 官僚的\n[经] 机僚化的', ""bjuәrәu'krætik"", 'bureaucratic', 'a. of or relating to or resembling a bureaucrat or bureaucracy'}"
gauntlet	Today, getting a permit requires you to run a bureaucratic gauntlet: You buy one of a limited number of federal leases, then go through a multiyear process to generate an environmental impact statement, then get additional state and local permits.

rightly	And at each step of the way, you may be opposed (rightly or not) by beachfront property owners, the tourism industry, fishermen, and environmental groups.Offshore wind holds a lot of promise: It’s getting cheaper and can play a key role in helping many countries decarbonize.Geothermal.	"{'rightly', 'r. with honesty', ""'raitli"", 'adv. 合适地, 正当地, 正确地'}"
volcanic	And geothermal is available only in certain places around the world; the best spots tend to be areas with aboveaverage volcanic activity.Although these problems mean that geothermal will contribute only modestly to the world’s power consumption, it’s still worth setting out to solve them one by one, just as we did with cars.	"{""a. relating to or produced by or consisting of volcanoes\ns. explosively unstable\ns. igneous rock produced by eruption and solidified on or near the earth's surface; rhyolite or andesite or basalt"", 'a. 火山的, 猛烈的\nn. 火山岩', ""vɒl'kænik"", 'volcanic'}"
vastly	Inventors have studied all the metals we could use in batteries, and it seems unlikely that there are materials that will make for vastly better batteries than the ones we’re already building.	"{'adv. 广大地, 许多, 巨大', 'vastly', ""'vɑ:stli"", 'r. to an exceedingly great extent or degree'}"
admire	I also admired the activists’ passion; I had seen students protesting the Vietnam War, and later the apartheid regime in South Africa, and I knew they had made a real difference.	"{""әd'maiә"", 'admire', 'vt. 赞美, 钦佩, 爱慕\nvi. 称赞, 惊奇', 'v. feel admiration for\nv. look at with admiration'}"
hydro	But we’ve already tapped most of the available hydropower.	"{'', 'hydro', ""'haidrәu"", 'n. 水疗医院'}"
stiff	This is a method of storing citysized amounts of energy, and it works like this: When electricity is cheap (for example, when a stiff wind is turning your turbines really fast), you pump water up a hill into a reservoir; then, when demand for power goes up, you let the water flow back down the hill, using it to spin a turbine and generate more electricity.Pumped hydro is the biggest form of gridscale electricity storage in the world.	{'stif', 'n. an ordinary man\ns. not moving or operating freely\ns. powerful\nr. extremely', 'stiff', 'a. 坚硬的, 严厉的, 呆板的, 生硬的, 刚强的, 强烈的, 粘的, 稠的, 艰难的\nn. 死尸, 醉鬼, 钞票\nvt. 不肯付...小费'}
aboveground	That’s no problem when they’re aboveground—the heat just dissipates into the air—but underground there’s no place for the heat to go.	"{""ә'bʌvgraund"", 'adv. 在地面上, 活着\na. 在地面上的, 活着的', 's. on or above the surface of the ground', 'aboveground'}"
molten	Engineers know about many materials that can stay hot for a long time without losing much energy; the most promising approach, which some scientists and companies are working on, is to store the heat in molten salt.At TerraPower, we’re trying to figure out how to use molten salt so that (if we’re able to build a plant) we don’t have to compete with solargenerated electricity during the day.	"{'molten', ""'mәultәn"", 's. reduced to liquid form by heating', 'a. 熔化的, 炽热的, 铸造的\nmelt的过去分词'}"
obsolete	But it’s also possible that some innovation will come along and make all these ideas obsolete, the way the personal computer came along and more or less made the typewriter unnecessary.Cheap hydrogen could do that for storing electricity.The reason is that hydrogen serves as a key ingredient in fuel cell batteries.	"{'s no longer in use', 'obsolete', 'a. 荒废的, 成废物的, 陈旧的, 老式的\nn. 废词, 废物', ""'ɒbsәli:t""}"

"{'typewriter', ""'taip.raitә"", 'n. hand-operated character printer for printing written messages one character at a time', 'n. 打字机'}"
pressurize	It’s easier to store the gas if you pressurize it (you can squeeze more into the samevolume container), but because hydrogen molecules are so small, when they’re under pressure, they can actually migrate through metals.	"{""'preʃәraiz"", 'pressurize', 'v. maintain a certain pressure\nv. increase the pressure in or of', 'vt. 迫使, 使增压, 密封, 使耐压\n[化] 增压'}"

migrate	It’s easier to store the gas if you pressurize it (you can squeeze more into the samevolume container), but because hydrogen molecules are so small, when they’re under pressure, they can actually migrate through metals.	"{'migrate', 'v. move from one country or region to another and settle there\nv. move periodically or seasonally', 'vi. 移动, 移往, 随季节而移居\n[计] 迁移程序', ""'maigreit""}"
electrolysis	It’s as if your gas tank slowly leaked gas as you filled up.Finally, the process of making hydrogen (called electrolysis) also requires various materials (known as electrolyzers) that are quite costly.	"{'electrolysis', 'n. (chemistry) a chemical decomposition reaction produced by passing an electric current through a solution containing ions\nn. removing superfluous or unwanted hair by passing an electric current through the hair root', 'n. 电分解, 电解, 以电针除痣\n[化] 电解', "".ilek'trɒlisis""}"
concentrated	When emissions come directly out of a coal plant, they’re highly concentrated, in the range of 10 percent carbon dioxide, but once they’re in the atmosphere, where DAC operates, they disperse widely.

disperse	When emissions come directly out of a coal plant, they’re highly concentrated, in the range of 10 percent carbon dioxide, but once they’re in the atmosphere, where DAC operates, they disperse widely.

rationale	My rationale: If you have limited resources to reduce emissions (and we do), then you’d get the biggest impact by moving to zero emissions rather than by spending a lot trying to reduce the demand for energy.I haven’t abandoned that view entirely, but I did soften it when I realized just how much land it will take to generate lots more electricity from solar and wind.	"{'n. (law) an explanation of the fundamental reasons (especially an explanation of the working of some device in terms of laws of nature)', 'n. 基本原理\n[医] 原理, 理论', 'rationale', "".ræʃә'nɑ:li""}"

shifting	Anything that reduces the scale we need to reach is helpful.There’s also a related approach called load shifting or demand shifting, which involves using power more consistently throughout the day.	"{'shifting', ""'ʃiftiŋ"", 's. continuously varying\ns. changing position or direction\ns. (of soil) unstable', '[计] 移位, 移位操作'}"
easiest	On an industrial level, energyintensive processes like treating wastewater and making hydrogen fuels could be done at a time of day when power is easiest to come by.If load shifting is going to have a significant impact, we’ll need some changes in policy as well as some technological advances.

nonessential	And in extreme cases, when electricity is especially hard to come by, we should have the ability to shed demand, meaning we’d ration electricity, prioritize the highest needs (say, hospitals), and shut down nonessential activities.

nestle	To make steel, you need pure iron and carbon; on its own, iron isn’t very strong, but add just the right amount of carbon—less than 1 percent, depending on the kind of steel you want—and the carbon atoms nestle themselves in between the iron atoms, giving the resulting steel its most important properties.	"{'vi. 舒适地坐定, 挨靠, 偎依\nvt. 抱, 安置', 'v. lie in a sheltered position\nv. position comfortably', 'nestle', ""'nesl""}"
crust	Carbon and iron aren’t hard to find—you can get carbon from coal, and iron is a common element in the earth’s crust.	{'crust', 'krʌst', 'n. the outer layer of the Earth\nn. a hard outer layer that covers something\nn. the trait of being rude and impertinent; inclined to take liberties\nv. form a crust or form into a crust', 'n. 外壳, 坚硬外皮, 面包皮\nvt. 盖以硬皮\nvi. 结硬皮'}

clustered	Carbon, it turns out, is useful in creating all sorts of different materials because it bonds easily with a wide variety of different elements; in the case of plastics, it’s usually clustered with hydrogen and oxygen.	{'clustered', '', 's. growing close together but not in dense mats', 'a. 成群的, 集束的\n[计] 成群的'}

inevitably	I think of it in three stages: We emit greenhouse gases (1) when we use fossil fuels to generate the electricity that factories need to run their operations; (2) when we use them to generate heat needed for different manufacturing processes, like melting iron ore to make steel; and (3) when we actually make these materials, like the way cement manufacturing inevitably creates carbon dioxide.	"{""in'evitәbli"", 'inevitably', 'r. in such a manner as could not be otherwise', 'adv. 不可避免地'}"

inject	One approach is to take recycled carbon dioxide—possibly captured during the process of making cement—and inject it back into the cement before it’s used at the construction site.	"{""in'dʒekt"", 'v. give an injection to\nv. to introduce (a new aspect or element)\nv. force or drive (a fluid or gas) into by piercing\nv. take by injection', 'vt. 注射, 注入, 使入轨\n[医] 注射', 'inject'}"

inexpensively	Electricity already accounts for about a quarter of all the energy used by the manufacturing sector worldwide; to power all these industrial processes, we need to both deploy the clean energy technology we already have and develop breakthroughs that let us generate and store lots of zerocarbon electricity inexpensively.	{'inexpensively', '', 'adv. 花费不多地；廉价地, 不践地', 'r in a cheap manner\nr with little expenditure of money'}
electrification	And soon we’ll need even more power, as we pursue another way to reduce emissions: electrification, which is the technique of using electricity instead of fossil fuels for some industrial processes.	"{'electrification', 'n. 起电, 带电, 电气化\n[化] 起电', ""i.lektrifi'keiʃәn"", 'n. the activity of thrilling or markedly exciting some person or group\nn. the act of providing electricity'}"
steelmaking	For example, one very cool approach for steelmaking is to use clean electricity to replace coal.	{'', 'steelmaking', 'n. 炼钢'}
purify	This technique is promising—it’s similar to a process we’ve been using for more than a century to purify aluminum—but like the other ideas for clean steel it hasn’t yet been proven to work at an industrial scale.

glued	Finally, buildings and roads can also be designed with the goal of limiting the use of cement and steel, and in some cases crosslaminated wood—made of layers of timber glued together into a stack—is sturdy enough to substitute for both materials.	{'ɡluːd', 'glued', 'v. 用胶水将物体粘合( glue的过去式和过去分词 )', 's. affixed or as if affixed with glue or paste'}

cheeseburger	And although I still love a good cheeseburger, I don’t eat them nearly as often as I used to—because of what I’ve learned about the impact that beef and other meats have on climate change.Raising animals for food is a major contributor of greenhouse gas emissions; it ranks as the highest contributor in the sector that experts call “agriculture, forestry, and other land use,” which in turn covers a huge range of human activity, from raising animals and growing crops to harvesting trees.	"{'n. 干酪汉堡包', 'cheeseburger', 'n. a hamburger with melted cheese on it', ""'tʃi:zbә:gә""}"
culprit	I know I was taken aback when I learned this: Because most of the articles I read about climate change focused on electricity generation, I assumed it must be the main culprit.The good news is that even though electricity is only 27 percent of the problem, it could represent much more than 27 percent of the solution.	"{'culprit', 'n. 犯人, 罪犯, 刑事被告\n[法] 犯罪者, 犯人, 罪犯', ""'kʌlprit"", 'n someone who perpetrates wrongdoing'}"
curb	It’s hard to get every country in the world to agree on anything—especially when you’re asking them to incur some new cost, like the expense of curbing carbon emissions.	"{'curb', 'kә:b', ""n. an edge between a sidewalk and a roadway consisting of a line of curbstones (usually forming part of a gutter)\nn. a horse's bit with an attached chain or strap to check the horse\nv. keep to the curb"", 'n. 抑制, 勒马绳, 边石\nvt. 抑制, 束缚, 勒住'}"
deforestation	We’ll also have to do something about deforestation and other uses of land, which together add a net 1.6 billion tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere while also destroying essential wildlife habitats.In keeping with such a wideranging subject, this chapter has a bit of everything.

biologist	* * *—In 1968, an American biologist named Paul Ehrlich published a bestselling book called The Population Bomb, in which he painted a grim picture of the future that was not far removed from the dystopian vision of novels like The Hunger Games.	"{'n. 生物学家\n[医] 生物学家', 'n. (biology) a scientist who studies living organisms', ""bai'ɒlәdʒist"", 'biologist'}"
starve	“In the 1970s and 1980s hundreds of millions of people will starve to death in spite of any crash programs embarked upon now.” Ehrlich also wrote that “India couldn’t possibly feed 200 million more people by 1980.”None of this came to pass.	{'stɑ:v', 'starve', 'v. be hungry; go without food\nv. die of food deprivation\nv. deprive of food\nv. deprive of a necessity and cause suffering', 'v.

spite	And there’s a chance of relatively sudden catastrophic climate change, if, for example, large sections of the earth’s permanently frozen ground (called permafrost) gets warm enough to melt and releases the huge amounts of greenhouse gases, mostly methane, that are trapped there.Despite the scientific uncertainties that remain, we understand enough to know that what’s coming will be bad.	{'spite', 'spait', 'n. 恶意, 怨恨, 使人烦恼的事物\nvt. 故意刁难, 欺侮', 'n feeling a need to see others suffer\nn malevolence by virtue of being malicious or spiteful or nasty\nv hurt the feelings of'}
malnutrition	In the United States, the average household spends less of its budget today on food than it did 30 years ago, a trend that’s being repeated in other parts of the world as well.I’m not saying that malnutrition isn’t a serious problem in some places.	"{'n. a state of poor nutrition; can result from insufficient or excessive or unbalanced diet or from inability to absorb foods', 'n. 营养失调, 营养不良\n[医] 营养不良', "".mælnju:'triʃәn"", 'malnutrition'}"

bred	He won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970, and we’re still feeling the impact of his work: Virtually all the wheat grown on earth is descended from the plants he bred.	{'bred', 'breed的过去式和过去分词', 'v call forth\nv copulate with a female, used especially of horses\nv cause to procreate (animals)\nv have young (animals) or reproduce (organisms)'}
downside	It was water, in the form of hydropower.Hydropower has a lot going for it—it’s relatively cheap—but it also has some big downsides.	"{""'daunsaid"", 'downside', 'n. a negative aspect of something that is generally positive', 'n. 底侧；下降趋势'}"
discus	When you use carbon dioxide equivalents, you aren’t fully accounting for this important shortterm effect.Nevertheless, they’re the best method we have for counting emissions, and they come up often in discussions about climate change, so I’ll use them in this book.	"{""'diskәs"", 'n. 铁饼, 掷铁饼比赛\n[医] 盘, 板, [圆]片', 'discus', 'n. an athletic competition in which a disk-shaped object is thrown as far as possible\nn. a disk used in throwing competitions'}"
calorie	We’ll need even more than that.Here’s why: As people get richer, they eat more calories, and in particular they eat more meat and dairy.	"{'n. a unit of heat equal to the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one kilogram of water by one degree at one atmosphere pressure; used by nutritionists to characterize the energy-producing potential in food\nn. unit of heat defined as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water by 1 degree centigrade at atmospheric pressure', 'n. 卡路里（热量单位）', 'calorie', ""'kælәri""}"
eats	The effects of climate change add up, one on top of the other.As it gets hotter, for example, mosquitoes will start living in new places (they like it humid, and they’ll move from areas that dry out to ones that become more humid), so we’ll see cases of malaria and other insectborne diseases where they’ve never appeared before.Heatstroke will be another major problem, and it’s linked to the humidity, of all things.	{'n informal terms for a meal\nv take in solid food\nv eat a meal; take a meal\nv take in food; used of animals only\nv worry or cause anxiety in a persistent way\nv use up (resources or materials)\nv cause to deteriorate due to the action of water, air, or an acid', 'abbr. 设备准确度测试站（Equipment Accuracy Test Station）', 'i:ts', 'eats'}
conundrum	It’s basically flat in the United States, Europe, Brazil, and Mexico, but it’s climbing rapidly in China and other developing countries.Here’s the conundrum: We need to produce much more food than we do today, but if we keep producing it with the same methods we use now, it will be a disaster for the climate.	"{'conundrum', ""kә'nʌndrәm"", 'n. 谜语, 难题', 'n a difficult problem'}"
pasture	Assuming we don’t make any improvements in the amount of food we get per acre of pasture or cropland, growing enough to feed 10 billion people will drive up foodrelated emissions by twothirds.Most countries aren’t consuming more meat than they used to.	"{'n. a field covered with grass or herbage and suitable for grazing by livestock', 'pasture', ""'pæstʃә"", 'n. 牧场, 草地, 牧草\nvt. 放牧\nvi. 吃草'}"
cropland	Assuming we don’t make any improvements in the amount of food we get per acre of pasture or cropland, growing enough to feed 10 billion people will drive up foodrelated emissions by twothirds.Most countries aren’t consuming more meat than they used to.	"{'', ""'krɔplænd"", '[经] 农地', 'cropland'}"
consuming	That would require building new transmission lines, a costly and timeconsuming task—especially if it involves crossing national borders—and the more power lines we install, the more the price of power goes up.	"{'consuming', 'a. 消费的', ""kәn'su:miŋ"", 's. very intense'}"
accidentally	(OECDFAO Agricultural Outlook 2020)Another concern: If we make a big push to generate energy from plants, we could accidentally spark a competition for cropland.	"{"".æksi'dentli"", 'adv. 偶然地, 意外地', 'r without advance planning\nr of a minor or subordinate nature\nr without intention; in an unintentional manner', 'accidentally'}"

inadvertently	But if we grow those crops on land that would otherwise be used to feed a growing population, we could inadvertently drive up food prices, pushing even more people into poverty and malnutrition while accelerating the already dangerous pace of deforestation.To avoid these traps, we’re going to need more Borlaugsized breakthroughs in the years ahead.	{'r without knowledge or intention', 'ˌɪnədˈvɜ:təntli', 'inadvertently', 'adv. 漫不经心地, 疏忽地; 非故意地'}

antitrust	When I was building Microsoft, I kept my distance from policy makers in Washington, D.C., and around the world, thinking they would only keep us from doing our best work.In part, the U.S. government’s antitrust suit against Microsoft in the late 1990s made me realize that we should’ve been engaging with policy makers all along.

borne	The effects of climate change add up, one on top of the other.As it gets hotter, for example, mosquitoes will start living in new places (they like it humid, and they’ll move from areas that dry out to ones that become more humid), so we’ll see cases of malaria and other insectborne diseases where they’ve never appeared before.Heatstroke will be another major problem, and it’s linked to the humidity, of all things.

excruciating	Sometimes it’s government policies themselves that make it hard to decarbonize.For example, if you want to use concrete in a building, the building code will spell out in excruciating detail how well that concrete has to perform—how strong it has to be, how much weight it can bear, and so on.	"{'excruciating', ""iks'kru:ʃieitiŋ"", 'v torment emotionally or mentally\nv subject to torture\ns extremely painful', 'a. 极痛苦的, 折磨人的, 精心制作的'}"

quota	It’s a vicious cycle: The government lowers the quota because it expects a shortfall, and the shortfalls keep happening because the government keeps lowering the quota.The lesson here is that policy makers need to be clear about the goal they’re trying to achieve and aware of the technologies they’re trying to promote.	"{'n. 配额, 限额\n[化] 定额', 'n. a prescribed number\nn. a proportional share assigned to each participant\nn. a limitation on imports', 'quota', ""'kwәutә""}"
shortfall	But a big reason is that the companies that might produce these biofuels, and the investors who might back them, haven’t had any certainty about the market.The executive branch has expected shortfalls in the supply of advanced biofuels, so it keeps lowering the targets.

Denmark	China, which accounts for a large and growing share of the world’s windgenerated power, has said it will soon stop subsidizing onshore wind projects because the electricity they produce will be just as cheap as the power from conventional sources.To understand how we got to this point, look at Denmark.
