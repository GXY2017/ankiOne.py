hungrily	And slowly, Harry looked into the faces of the other people in the mirror, and saw other pairs of green eyes like his, other noses like his, even a little old man who looked as though he had Harry’s knobbly knees — Harry was looking at his family, for the first time in his life.The Potters smiled and waved at Harry and he stared hungrily back at them, his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping to fall right through it and reach them.

nearsighted	Harry must have walked straight past him, so desperate to get to the mirror he hadn’t noticed him.“I — I didn’t see you, sir.”“Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you,” said Dumbledore, and Harry was relieved to see that he was smiling.“So,” said Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with Harry, “you, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised.”“I didn’t know it was called that, Sir.”“But I expect you’ve realized by now what it does?”“It — well — it shows me my family —”“And it showed your friend Ron himself as head boy.”“How did you know —?”“I don’t need a cloak to become invisible,” said Dumbledore gently.

referee	She had also lent him Quidditch Through the Ages, which turned out to be a very interesting read.Harry learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a Quidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a World Cup match in 1473; that Seekers were usually the smallest and fastest players, and that most serious Quidditch accidents seemed to happen to them; that although people rarely died playing Quidditch, referees had been known to vanish and turn up months later in the Sahara Desert.Hermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since Harry and Ron had saved her from the mountain troll, and she was much nicer for it.

drip	Neville thought Harry had a bad case of exam nerves because Harry couldn’t sleep, but the truth was that Harry kept being woken by his old nightmare, except that it was now worse than ever because there was a hooded figure dripping blood in it.Maybe it was because they hadn’t seen what Harry had seen in the forest, or because they didn’t have scars burning on their foreheads, but Ron and Hermione didn’t seem as worried about the Stone as Harry.	{'drip', 'n. 水滴\nv.
